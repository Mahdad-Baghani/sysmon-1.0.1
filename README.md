# sysmon-1.0.1
sysmon.py is a program designed to monitor your system.

Install by navigating to the directory you have Setup.py stored in.

Then, type `sudo python Setup.py` in the terminal.
It will not work with python3, as it is written in python2.

To use, type `sysmon` into the command line.

The log is stored at `/var/log/sysmon.log`.
This program will work with your LINUX system provided you have the right hardware.
